SEVAITS Crypto Trade Agent

Cryptocurrency trade planning calculator and execution bot

I've been investing for over a decade now, starting off with a small brokerage account in the early aughts, moving on to manage my own retirement account, and now as a cryptocurrency investor. One of the most important things that separates good traders from broke ones is having a trade plan. I've been using a Google sheet to track my trades, but as the months have gone on the amount of information I've wanted to track has grown and grown. This program will take that same information behind my trade plan and automate the execution of it.

The main goal of any investor is to preserve capital. I follow Alexander Elder's Two Percent Rule, explained in his excellent book, 'The New Trading for a Living'. Simply put, it states that a trader should not risk more than two percent of their capital on any trade.

When starting a new trade plan, TP will calculate your max loss per trade and will provide hard stop loss price based on your planned capital deployment and entry price. The trader can then adjust the position size to increase the stop loss to a level that falls below recent support, to make sure that they don't get washed out of a trade on a dip. TP will provide figures based on the planned exit price, allowing you to quantify profit amounts and risk/reward ratio.

Once a trade plan has been entered, CTA will open the position by executing the trade and setting a conditional order for the stop. It will monitor the token's price, and will execute an exit as desired. The program will be able to automate scaling in and out of a position, and provide trailing stop capabilites if desired. Users can either specify profit taking of the entire position, or recouping initial capital and holding profits in the exchanged token. We only plan on supporting the Bittrex exchange for our initial release version of CTA.
